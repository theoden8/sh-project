## solver

The current version of solver is relatively slow and can't handle large graphs. It is written to work iteratively, and chooses which options to iterate and how, and when to backtrack.

Some heuristics are being sought to improve its basic performance, such as connectedness to existing nodes, error heuristic and more.

## lattice

Below is a lattice image generated by putting in partial order graph of homomorphisms of all non-isomorphic connected graphs of size up to 7, and some more randomly generated bigger graphs:

![lattice_adj](images/lattice_adj.png)

# prerequisites

```bash
env python3 -m pip install -r --user requirements.txt
env python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
# edit gap_config.sh and set GAP=/path/to/gap
```

For full functionality, you will also need:

* **nauty**
* **gap**
* **graphviz**
* **librsvg2-bin**
* **ffmpeg**

### usage

#### generating/downloading graphs

```bash
# download small graphs:
./generate_small_graphs.py
# generate some bigger graphs (15 being the size of the graph):
./generate_connected_graph.py 15
```

#### homomorphism solver

```bash
# use GAP to check if G -> H:
./gap_is_homomorphic_gh <gfile> <hfile>
# use python solver to check if G -> H:
time ./solve_homomorphism.py <gfile> <hfile>
# plot homomorphism G -> H (side by side):
./plot_homomorphism.py <gfile> <hfile>
# profile homomorphism solver G -> H:
./profile_homomorphism.py <gfile> <hfile>
# test the solver:
./gap_test_solver
```

#### lattice

```bash
# make lattice out of given graphs, by specifying graphs in the argument list, e.g.:
./make_lattice.py small_graphs/graph_{1,2,3,4,5}_*.json
# verify relations
./gap_test_lattice_relations
# verify the most important relations
./test_important_lattice_relations
# open visualization/index.html or visualization/index_d3.html for interactive graph
```
