# files

* graph_utils.py: simple graph utilities, such as generating, drawing etc

* homomorphism_solver.pyx: mediocre homomorphism solver (rewritten in Cython)

* plot_graph_families.py: generates pictures of some graph families. Exists here for the purposes of testing graph_utils

* solve_homomorphism.py: tries to find a homomorphism between two given graphs

* plot_homomorphism.py: generates an image of a given graph homomorphism

* profile_homomorphism.py: generates an overview of python profiling information on the solver

* setup.py: compile homomorphism solver into a shared library

  ---

* generate_small_graphs.py: a script to download Brendan McKay's dataset of graphs and write them into **small_graphs/** folder in a more convenient format (JSON). Uses **nauty** to decode g6 format of the original dataset

* graph_dataset_utils.py: a helper file for *generate_small_graphs.py*

* generate_connected_graph.py: a python program that generates a connected graph of given size and puts it into **graphs/** folder

  ---

* test_solver: compares GAP solver's result with the solver

* gap_homomorphism_finder: uses GAP graph homomorphism finder to find a homomorphism between two graphs

* gap_homomorphism_core_finder: uses GAP and a dataset of small graphs to find a potential core by trying to find a homomorphism from a given graph

* gap_is_homomorphic_gh: uses GAP solver to print "YES" or "NO" if two graphs are homomorphic

  ---

* make_lattice.py: incrementally constructs a partial order graph out of given files, and produces an image

* quick_notes.pdf: updated version of notes from papers

## solver

The current version of solver is relatively slow and can't handle large graphs. It is written to work iteratively, and chooses which options to iterate and how, and when to backtrack.

Some heuristics are being sought to improve its basic performance, such as connectedness to existing nodes, error heuristic and more.

## lattice

Below is a lattice image generated by putting in partial order graph of homomorphisms of all non-isomorphic connected graphs of size up to 7, and some more randomly generated bigger graphs:

![lattice](images/lattice.png)

# prerequisites

```bash
env python3 -m pip install -r --user requirements.txt
env python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
# edit gap_config.sh and set GAP=/path/to/gap
```

For full functionality, you will also need:

* **nauty**
* **gap**
* **graphviz**

### usage

```bash
# download small graphs:
./generate_small_graphs.py
# generate some bigger graphs (15 being the size of the graph):
./generate_connected_graph.py 15
# use gap to check if two graphs are homomorphic:
./gap_is_homomorphic_gh <gfile> <hfile>
# test homomorphism solver
# create gap_config.sh and specify a path to GAP
./test_solver
# make lattice out of given graphs, by specifying graphs in the argument list, e.g.:
./make_lattice.py small_graphs/graph_{1,2,3,4,5}_*.json
```
