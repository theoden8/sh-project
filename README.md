# about

This repository contains files related to the SH project called "Graph Homomorphisms".

# files

* graph_utils.py - simple graph utilities, such as generating, drawing etc
* homomorphism_solver.py - moderately good homomorphism solver
* plot_graph_families.py - generates pictures of some graph families. Exists here for the purposes of testing graph_utils.
* plot_homomorphism.py - generates pictures of some graph homomorphisms, with full logging possible on how the homomorphism was generated/found, etc. Thus it serves as an interactive debugging facility.
